# flask_blog
This blog project is based on the flask [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) by Corey Schafer on Youtube. The purpose is to become more familiar and comfortable with flask while honing Python, HTML/CSS, and api skills.

The project utilizes flask and html/css. Once the tutorial is completed, I will either update this repository to be for boilerplate flask application/website or I will create a new repository for the same.


Note: This README is temporary and will be updated in the future depending on progress.
